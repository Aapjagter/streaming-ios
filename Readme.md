#Red5 Pro iOS Streaming Examples

This repository contains a simple project with a number of examples that can be used for testing and reference.  

##Requirements

You will need a functional Red5 Pro server web (or locally) accessible for the client to connect too.  

For more information visit http://red5pro.com.

##Setup

You will need to modify **/Red5Streaming/connection.plist** to point to your server instance.  If you do not, the examples will not function when you build.

Once you have modified your settings, you can run the application for simulator or device. 

***Note: Publishing does not currently work on simulator!***
